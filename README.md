# 🌸 Flower Species Classifier
This project involves training an image classifier to recognize different species of flowers. Imagine integrating this into a phone app to identify flowers by capturing their images with a camera. The classifier is trained on a dataset containing **102 flower categories** and can be exported for practical applications.

## ✨ Features

- 🎨 **Training Data Augmentation**: Enhances training data with random scaling, rotations, mirroring, and cropping using `torchvision` transforms.
- 🔍 **Pretrained Network**: Leverages a pretrained model (e.g., `VGG16`) from `torchvision.models` for feature extraction.
- 🤖 **Feedforward Classifier**: A new feedforward network is designed to classify images using the features extracted by the pretrained model.
- 💾 **Model Saving and Loading**: Supports saving the trained model as a checkpoint, including hyperparameters and `class_to_idx` mapping, and restoring it with a dedicated function.
- 📸 **Image Processing**: Includes a function to preprocess images into a format suitable for prediction.
- 🏷️ **Class Prediction**: Predicts the top K probable classes of an input image and provides a visualization with Matplotlib.
- 🖥️ **Command Line Applications**:
  - Train a new model using `train.py`.
  - Predict flower species using `predict.py`.

## 📜 Rubrics and Implementation

### Part 1 - Development Notebook

#### 🧩 Package Imports
- All required packages and modules are imported in the first cell of the notebook.

#### 🛠️ Data Preparation
- **Augmentation**: Uses `torchvision.transforms` for scaling, rotations, mirroring, and cropping.
- **Normalization**: Normalizes training, validation, and testing datasets.
- **Data Loading**: Uses `torchvision.datasets.ImageFolder` and `torch.utils.data.DataLoader` for loading datasets.

#### 🏗️ Model
- **Pretrained Network**: Loads a pretrained model (e.g., `VGG16`) with frozen parameters.
- **Feedforward Classifier**: Implements a custom classifier for flower species recognition.

#### 🚀 Training
- Trains the classifier parameters while keeping the feature network static.
- Displays validation loss and accuracy during training.

#### 🧪 Testing
- Measures accuracy on test data.

#### 💾 Saving and Loading
- Saves the model checkpoint with hyperparameters and `class_to_idx` dictionary.
- Includes a function to load the checkpoint and rebuild the model.

#### 🖼️ Image Prediction
- Implements `process_image` to convert a PIL image into model input format.
- Includes `predict` to return the top K probable classes for a given image.

#### ✅ Sanity Check
- Displays an image with its top 5 most probable classes using Matplotlib.

### Part 2 - Command Line Application

#### 🎓 Training with `train.py`
- Trains a new model and saves it as a checkpoint.
- Prints training loss, validation loss, and validation accuracy during training.
- Supports selecting from multiple model architectures (e.g., `VGG16`, `ResNet`).
- Allows setting hyperparameters such as learning rate, hidden units, and epochs.
- Enables training on GPU if available.

#### 📊 Prediction with `predict.py`
- Reads an image and model checkpoint, predicting the most likely class and probability.
- Displays the top K classes and probabilities.
- Loads a JSON file to map class indices to category names.
- Supports GPU-based predictions.
